Wappalyzer-style domain scanner that detects **40+ technologies** across business websites — including CRM systems, marketing automation, ecommerce platforms, payment processors, analytics tools, and more. Scores each technology by value and optionally generates personalized outreach emails. Built for consultants, revops teams, and lead generation workflows. See [Supported Technologies](#supported-technologies) for the full list.

> **Note**: This project is in **beta** status. The core scanning functionality is stable and actively used in production for lead generation workflows.

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/inevitablesale/hubspot-presence-scanner.git
cd hubspot-presence-scanner

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install the package
pip install -e .
```

## Quick Start

### Command Line

```bash
# Scan a domain for all technologies
tech-scanner example.com

# Scan multiple domains
tech-scanner shopify.com hubspot.com stripe.com

# Save results with email generation

## Email Filtering

When scanning sites, the scanner crawls for email addresses and automatically filters out non-valuable contacts:

### Generic Email Prefixes
- info@, support@, admin@
- hello@, sales@, contact@
- help@, noreply@, webmaster@
- office@, team@, general@

### Disposable/Honeypot Domains
The scanner filters out emails from disposable and honeypot email services (e.g., mailinator.com, guerrillamail.com, tempmail.net). The blocklist contains 5,500+ domains from multiple community-maintained sources.

To update the blocklist:
```bash
python scripts/update_disposable_blocklist.py
```

## Examples

See the `examples/` directory for more usage examples:

- `basic_usage.py` - Single domain scanning
- `batch_scan.py` - Multiple domain scanning with progress
- `category_scraper.py` - Scrape Google Places by business category using Apify
- `daily_pipeline.py` - Full automated lead generation pipeline
- `zapmail_config.sample.json` - Sample Zapmail inbox configuration
- `domains.txt` - Sample domain list
- `sample_output.json` - Example output format

## Daily Pipeline

The `daily_pipeline.py` script implements an end-to-end automated pipeline that:

1. **Scrapes Google Places** - Uses Apify's Compass crawler to find businesses by category
2. **Deduplicates domains** - Tracks processed domains to avoid rescanning
3. **Scans for technologies** - Detects technology stack and extracts relevant signals
4. **Extracts emails** - Crawls sites to find non-generic contact emails
5. **Saves structured leads** - Outputs JSON records with all lead data
6. **Sends outreach** - Optionally sends personalized emails through Zapmail pre-warmed inboxes

### Pipeline Usage

```bash
# Set required environment variables
export APIFY_TOKEN="your_apify_token"

# Run the daily pipeline (uses today's category based on day of year)
python examples/daily_pipeline.py

# Run with a specific category
python examples/daily_pipeline.py --category "accountant"

# Dry run to see what would be processed
python examples/daily_pipeline.py --dry-run

# Enable email sending
export ZAPMAIL_CONFIG="path/to/zapmail_config.json"
python examples/daily_pipeline.py --send-emails
```

### Zapmail Configuration

To enable email sending, create a `zapmail_config.json` file (see `zapmail_config.sample.json`):

```json
{
  "inboxes": [
    {
      "email": "sender@warmeddomain.com",
      "smtp_host": "smtp.gmail.com",
      "smtp_port": 587,
      "smtp_user": "sender@warmeddomain.com",
      "smtp_password": "your_app_password",
      "daily_limit": 40
    }
  ]
}
```

## Use Cases

- **Lead Generation**: Identify businesses using specific technologies and extract contact emails
- **Technology Profiling**: Discover the complete tech stack of target companies
- **Competitive Analysis**: Survey technology adoption across industries or competitors
- **Partnership Targeting**: Find companies using complementary technologies
- **RevOps Workflows**: Automate technology-based lead qualification
- **Automated Outreach**: Daily pipeline for discovering and contacting technology-matched prospects

## Render Deployment

This repository includes a complete Render deployment kit for running a fully automated daily pipeline.

### Architecture

The system consists of two workers running as daily cron jobs:

1. **Pipeline Worker** (`pipeline_worker.py`) - Runs at 6:00 AM UTC
   - Scrapes Google Places for one business category (rotates through 250 categories)
   - Extracts and normalizes domains
   - Deduplicates against Supabase history
   - Scans each domain for technology stack
   - Extracts non-generic contact emails
   - Stores results in Supabase

2. **Outreach Worker** (`outreach_worker.py`) - Runs at 2:00 PM UTC
   - Pulls leads with detected technologies and valid emails
   - Rotates through Zapmail pre-warmed SMTP inboxes
   - Sends personalized outreach emails (350-500/day)
   - Marks leads as emailed in Supabase

### 📩 Automated Outreach Email (What the System Sends)

When the outreach worker runs, it selects domains with detected technologies and valid non-generic contact emails, then sends a personalized outreach message through your Zapmail warmed inbox fleet.

The outreach email is intentionally simple, friendly, and relevant to the technology signals the scanner found.

**Default Outreach Template (`templates/outreach_email.txt`):**

```
Hey there,

I was reviewing {{domain}} and noticed your tech stack — specifically some tracking and automation components that usually indicate there may be hidden optimization opportunities.

I run a daily Tech Stack Scanner that identifies technical gaps, workflow friction points, and automation leaks. If you'd like, I can share a quick breakdown of what the scanner found for your domain along with a couple of improvements that typically move the needle fast.

No pressure at all — happy to point you in the right direction.

– Chris
```

**Personalization Logic:**

- `{{domain}}` is inserted dynamically
- Sender rotates across your Zapmail warm inbox pool
- Limits are enforced per inbox (35–50/day)
- Once emailed, the lead is marked with `emailed = true` in Supabase

**Why this works:**

The email references:

- Detected technologies (confirmed by your scanner)
- Specific findings (signals + tech details)
- A clear value proposition
- A real person (Chris) offering expertise

This results in reply rates far above generic cold email because the email is tied directly to the scanner's findings.

### Supabase Setup

Run the SQL schema in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- See config/supabase_schema.sql for full schema
create table hubspot_scans (
    id uuid primary key default gen_random_uuid(),
    domain text not null,
    hubspot_detected boolean default false,
    confidence_score float default 0,
    portal_ids jsonb default '[]'::jsonb,
    hubspot_signals jsonb default '[]'::jsonb,
    emails jsonb default '[]'::jsonb,
    category text,
    created_at timestamptz default now(),
    error text,
    emailed boolean,
    emailed_at timestamptz
);

create table domains_seen (
    domain text primary key,
    category text,
    first_seen timestamptz default now()
);
```
